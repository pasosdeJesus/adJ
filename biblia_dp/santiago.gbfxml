<sv id="James-1-1">
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-2">
Count it all joy, my

<rb>brothers
<t lang="es"/><rf>The word for «brothers» here and where context allows may
also be correctly translated «brothers and sisters» or «siblings.»<t lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>
, when
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> fall into various temptations, 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-3">
knowing that the testing of your
faith produces endurance. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-4">
Let endurance have its perfect work, that
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-5">
But if any of
you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without
reproach; and it will be given to him. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-6">
But let him ask in faith, without
any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind
and tossed. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-7">
For let that man not think that he will receive anything
from the Lord. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-8">
He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-1-9">
But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;

</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-10">
and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the
grass, he will pass away. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-11">
For the sun arises with the scorching wind,
and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its
appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-1-12">
Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been
approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those
who love him. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-13">
Let no man say when he is tempted, «I am tempted by God,»
for God can´t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-14">
But
each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.

</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-15">
Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it
is full grown, brings forth death. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-16">
Don´t be deceived, my beloved
brothers. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-17">
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming
down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning
shadow. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-18">
Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that
we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-1-19">
So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to
speak, and slow to anger; 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-20">
for the anger of man doesn´t produce the
righteousness of God. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-21">
Therefore, putting away all filthiness and
overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is
able to 
<rb>save your souls
<t lang="es"/><rf>or, preserve your life.<t lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>
. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-22">
But be
<wi type="T" value="P"/>
doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-23">
For
if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man beholding
his natural face in a mirror; 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-24">
for he sees himself, and goes away, and
immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-25">
But he who looks into the
perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who
forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-1-26">
If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn´t
bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man´s religion is worthless.

</sv>
		<sv id="James-1-27">
Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit
the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained
by the world.

<cm>
<sv id="James-2-1">
My brothers, don´t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory
with partiality. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-2">
For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes
into your 
<rb>synagogue
<t lang="es"/><rf>or, meeting<t lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>
, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in; 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-3">
and
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say,
«Sit here in a good place;» and you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> tell the poor man, «Stand there,» or
«Sit by my footstool;» 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-4">
haven´t you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> shown partiality among
yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-5">
Listen, my beloved
brothers. Didn´t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in
faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?

</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-6">
But you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> have dishonored the poor man. Don´t the rich oppress you,
and personally drag you before the courts? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-7">
Don´t they blaspheme the
honorable name by which you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> are called? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-8">
However, if you
<wi type="T" value="P"/>
fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, «You shall love your
neighbor as yourself,» you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> do well. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-9">
But if you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> show
partiality, you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.

</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-10">
For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he
has become guilty of all. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-11">
For he who said, «Do not commit adultery,»
said also, «Do not commit murder.» Now if you do not commit adultery, but
murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-12">
So speak
<wi type="T" value="P"/>, and
so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-13">
For judgment is
without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-2-14">
What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no
works? Can faith save him? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-15">
And if a brother or sister is naked and in
lack of daily food, 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-16">
and one of you tells them, «Go in peace, be
<wi type="T" value="P"/>
warmed and filled;» and yet you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> didn´t give them the things the body
needs, what good is it? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-17">
Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in
itself. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-18">
Yes, a man will say, «You have faith, and I have works.» Show
me your faith from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-2-19">
You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and
shudder. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-20">
But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works
is dead? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-21">
Wasn´t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he
offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-22">
You see that faith worked with
his works, and by works faith was perfected; 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-23">
and the Scripture was
fulfilled which says, «Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as
righteousness;» and he was called the friend of God. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-24">
You
<wi type="T" value="P"/> see then
that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-25">
In like
manner wasn´t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she
received the messengers, and sent them out another way? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-2-26">
For as the body
apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.

<sv id="James-3-1">
Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will
receive heavier judgment. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-2">
For in many things we all stumble. If anyone
doesn´t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole
body also. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-3">
Indeed, we put bits into the horses´ mouths so that they may
obey us, and we guide their whole body. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-4">
Behold, the ships also, though
they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very
small rudder, wherever the pilot desires. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-5">
So the tongue is also a little
member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large
forest! 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-6">
And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our
members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the
course of nature, and is set on fire by 
<rb>Gehenna.
<t lang="es"/><rf>Gehenna is a name
that describes a burning Hell with rotting bodies and unclean things in
it<t lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>
 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-7">
For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the
sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-8">
But nobody can tame the
tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-9">
With it we bless
our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of
God. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-10">
Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My
brothers, these things ought not to be so. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-11">
Does a spring send out from
the same opening fresh and bitter water? 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-12">
Can a fig tree, my brothers,
yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh
water.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="James-3-13">
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good
conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-14">
But if
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don´t boast
and don´t lie against the truth. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-15">
This wisdom is not that which comes
down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-16">
For where
jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.

</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-17">
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle,
reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisy. 
</sv>
		<sv id="James-3-18">
Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who
make peace.

Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don´t they come
from your pleasures that war in your members?

You
<wi type="T" value="P"/> lust, and don´t
have. You
<wi type="T" value="P"/> kill, covet, and can´t obtain. You

You

You

		<sv id="James-4-4">
You
<wi type="T" value="P"/> adulterers and adulteresses, don´t
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever
therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.

</sv>

Or do you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> think that the Scripture says in vain, «The Spirit who
lives in us yearns jealously»?

But he gives more grace. Therefore it
says, «God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.»

Be subject

Draw

<sv id="James-4-11">
Don´t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a
brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law.
But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.

Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who
are you to judge another?

Whereas you

But now you

Your riches are corrupted and your garments are

Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion

You

Behold, the wages
