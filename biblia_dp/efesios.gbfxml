<sv id="Ephesians-1-3">
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ; 
</sv>

even
as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be
holy and without blemish before him in love;

having predestined us for
adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good
pleasure of his desire,

to the praise of the glory of his grace, by
which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,

in whom we have our
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to
the riches of his grace,

which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom

his good pleasure which he purposed in him

fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the
heavens, and the things on the earth, in him; 
</sv>

in whom also we were
assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of
him who works all things after the counsel of his will;

to the end that
we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:

in whom you

who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the

and what
is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to
that working of the strength of his might

far above all rule, and authority, and power, and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in
that which is to come.

He put all things in subjection under his feet,

among whom we also all once lived
in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and

But God, being rich

even when we were

Therefore remember that once you

flesh, made by hands);

		<sv id="Ephesians-2-12">
that you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> were at that time separate from
Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the
covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

But now in Christ Jesus you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> who once were far off are made near in
the blood of Christ. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Ephesians-2-14">
For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke
down the middle wall of partition, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Ephesians-2-15">
having abolished in the flesh the
hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might
create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;

and might
reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the
hostility thereby. 
</sv>

He came and preached peace to you who were far off

For through him we both have our access in
one Spirit to the Father.

So then you
