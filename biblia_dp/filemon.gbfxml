<tt>Paul´s Letter to Philemon<t lang="es"></t></tt>

<sv num="1" id="Philemon-1-1"/>
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to
Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, 
<sv num="2" id="Philemon-1-2"/>
to the beloved Apphia, to
Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: 
<sv num="3" id="Philemon-1-3"/>
Grace
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sv num="4" id="Philemon-1-4"/>
I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 
<sv num="5" id="Philemon-1-5"/>
hearing
of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and
toward all the saints; 
<sv num="6" id="Philemon-1-6"/>
that the fellowship of your faith may become
effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ
Jesus. 
<sv num="7" id="Philemon-1-7"/>
For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts
of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

<sv num="8" id="Philemon-1-8"/>
Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that
which is appropriate, 
<sv num="9" id="Philemon-1-9"/>
yet for love´s sake I rather beg, being such a one
as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
<sv num="10" id="Philemon-1-10"/>
I beg you for
my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains,

<rb>Onesimus,
<t lang="es"></t><rf>Onesimus means «useful.»<t lang="es"></t></rf>
</rb>
 
<sv num="11" id="Philemon-1-11"/>
who once was useless to
you, but now is useful to you and to me. 
<sv num="12" id="Philemon-1-12"/>
I am sending him back.
Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, 
<sv num="13" id="Philemon-1-13"/>
whom I desired to keep
with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.

<sv num="14" id="Philemon-1-14"/>
But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your
goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. 
<sv num="15" id="Philemon-1-15"/>
For perhaps he
was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him
forever, 
<sv num="16" id="Philemon-1-16"/>
no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved
brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and
in the Lord.

<sv num="17" id="Philemon-1-17"/>
If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.

<sv num="18" id="Philemon-1-18"/>
But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my
account. 
<sv num="19" id="Philemon-1-19"/>
I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to
mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). 
<sv num="20" id="Philemon-1-20"/>
Yes,
brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.

<sv num="21" id="Philemon-1-21"/>
Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you
will do even beyond what I say.
</cm>
<cm>

<sv num="22" id="Philemon-1-22"/>
Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers
I will be restored to you.
</cm>
<cm>

<sv num="23" id="Philemon-1-23"/>
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 
<sv num="24" id="Philemon-1-24"/>
as do
Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 
<sv num="25" id="Philemon-1-25"/>
The grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
