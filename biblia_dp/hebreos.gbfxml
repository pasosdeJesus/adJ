<sv id="Hebrews-1-1">
God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets
at many times and in various ways, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-2">
has at the end of these days spoken
to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he
made the worlds. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-3">
His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of
his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had
by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-4">
having become so much better than the angels, as he has
inherited a more excellent name than they have. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-5">
For to which of the
angels did he say at any time, 

<cl/><fp>
«You are my Son,
<cl/>
Today have I become your father?»
</fp>

<cl/>
and again, 

<cl/><fp>
«I will be to him a Father,
<cl/>
And he will be to me a Son?» 
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-6">
Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, «Let all
the angels of God worship him.» 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-7">
Of the angels he says,

<cl/><fp>
«Who makes his angels winds,
<cl/>
And his servants a flame of fire.»
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-8">
but of the Son he says,

<cl/>
«Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
<cl/>
The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-9">
You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
<cl/>
Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your
fellows.»


<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-10">
And,

<cl/>
«You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
<cl/>
The heavens are the works of your hands.
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-11">
They will perish, but you continue.
<cl/>
They all will grow old like a garment does.
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-12">
As a mantle you will roll them up,
<cl/>
And they will be changed;
<cl/>
But you are the same.
<cl/>
Your years will not fail.»


<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-13">
But of which of the angels has he said at any time,

<cl/><fp>
«Sit at my right hand,
<cl/>
Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?»
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-1-14">
Aren´t they all ministering spirits, sent out to do service for the
sake of those who will inherit salvation?
<cl/>

</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-2">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-2-1">
Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were
heard, lest perhaps we drift away. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-2">
For if the word spoken through angels
proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just
recompense; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-3">
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvationwhich
at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by
those who heard; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-4">
God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and
wonders, and by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit,
according to his own will? 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-5">
For he didn´t subject the world to come,
of which we speak, to angels. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-6">
But one has somewhere testified,
saying,

<cl/>
«What is man, that you think of him?
<cl/>
Or the son of man, that you care for him?
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-7">
You made him a little lower than the angels;
<cl/>
You crowned him with glory and honor.
<rb>
<t xml:lang="es"/><rf>TR adds «and set him over the works
of your hands»<t xml:lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-8">
You have put all things in subjection under his feet.»


<cl/>
For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
subject to him. But now we don´t see all things subjected to him, yet.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-9">
But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus,
because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the
grace of God he should taste of death for everyone. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-10">
For it became him,
for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many
children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through
sufferings. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-11">
For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are
all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them

<rb>brothers
<t xml:lang="es"/><rf>The word for «brothers» here and where context allows may
also be correctly translated «brothers and sisters» or «siblings.»<t xml:lang="es"/></rf>
</rb>
,

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-12">
saying,

<cl/><fp>
«I will declare your name to my brothers.
<cl/>
In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.»
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-13">
Again, «I will put my trust in him.» Again, «Behold, here am I and the
children whom God has given me.» 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-14">
Since then the children have shared in
flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that
through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that
is, the devil, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-15">
and might deliver all of them who through fear of death
were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-16">
For most assuredly, not to
angels does he give help, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-17">
Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers,
that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining
to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-2-18">
For in that he
himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are
tempted.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-3">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-3-1">
Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider
the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-2">
who was faithful
to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-3">
For he has
been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the
house has more honor than the house. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-4">
For every house is built by
someone; but he who built all things is God. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-5">
Moses indeed was faithful
in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were
afterward to be spoken, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-6">
but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house;
whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our
hope firm to the end. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-7">
Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, 

<cl/>
«Today if you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> will hear his voice,
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-8">
Don´t harden your hearts, as in the provocation,
<cl/>
Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-9">
Where your fathers tested me by proving me,
<cl/>
And saw my works for forty years.
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-10">
Therefore I was displeased with that generation,
<cl/>
And said, `They always err in their heart,
<cl/>
But they didn´t know my ways;´
<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-11">
As I swore in my wrath,
<cl/>
`They will not enter into my rest.´»


<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-12">
Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart
of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-13">
but exhort one
another day by day, so long as it is called «today;» lest any one of you be
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-14">
For we have become partakers of
Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-15">
while it is said,

<cl/><fp>
«Today if you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> will hear his voice,
<cl/>
Don´t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.»
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-16">
For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn´t all those who came out
of Egypt by Moses? 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-17">
With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn´t it
with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-18">
To whom did
he swear that they wouldn´t enter into his rest, but to those who were
disobedient? 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-3-19">
We see that they were not able to enter in because of
unbelief.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-4">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-4-1">
Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps a promise being left of
entering into his rest, anyone of you should seem to have come short of it.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-2">
For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did,
but the word they heard didn´t profit them, because it wasn´t mixed with
faith by those who heard. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-3">
For we who have believed do enter into that
rest, even as he has said, «As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into
my rest;» although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-4">
For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, «God rested on the
seventh day from all his works;» 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-5">
and in this place again, «They will not
enter into my rest.»

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-4-6">
Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to
whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of
disobedience, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-7">
he again defines a certain day, today, saying through
David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),

<cl/><fp>
«Today if you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> will hear his voice,
<cl/>
Don´t harden your hearts.»
</fp>

<cl/>

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-8">
For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of
another day. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-9">
There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of
God. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-10">
For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from
his works, as God did from his. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-11">
Let us therefore give diligence to
enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of
disobedience. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-12">
For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper
than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and
spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and
intentions of the heart.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-4-13">
There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are
naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-14">
Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens,
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-15">
For we
don´t have a high priest who can´t be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet
without sin. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-4-16">
Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of
grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of
need.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-5">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-5-1">
For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for
men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-2">
The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant
and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-3">
Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as
well as for himself. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-4">
Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is
called by God, just like Aaron was. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-5">
So also Christ didn´t glorify
himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,

<cl/><fp>
«You are my Son.
<cl/>
Today I have become your father.»
</fp>


</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-5-6">
As he says also in another place,

<cl/><fp>
«You are a priest forever,
<cl/>
After the order of Melchizedek.»
</fp>


</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-5-7">
He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions
with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and
having been heard for his godly fear, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-8">
though he was a Son, yet learned
obedience by the things which he suffered. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-9">
Having been made perfect, he
became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-10">
named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-11">
About
him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> have
become dull of hearing. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-12">
For when by reason of the time you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> ought
to be teachers, you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> again need to have someone teach you the rudiments
of the first principles of the oracles of God. You
<wi type="T" value="P"/> have come to need
milk, and not solid food. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-13">
For everyone who lives on milk is not
experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-5-14">
But solid
food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses
exercised to discern good and evil.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-6">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-6-1">
Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ,
let us press on to perfectionnot laying again a foundation of repentance
from dead works, of faith toward God, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-2">
of the teaching of baptisms, of
laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-3">
This will we do, if God permits. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-4">
For concerning those who were once
enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the
Holy Spirit, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-5">
and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age
to come, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-6">
and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to
repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put
him to open shame. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-7">
For the land which has drunk the rain that comes
often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is
also tilled, receives blessing from God; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-8">
but if it bears thorns and
thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-6-9">
But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that
accompany salvation, even though we speak like this. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-10">
For God is not
unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you
<wi type="T" value="P"/>
showed toward his name, in that you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> served the saints, and still do
serve them. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-11">
We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence
to the fullness of hope even to the end, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-12">
that you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> won´t be
sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the
promises. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-13">
For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear
by none greater, he swore by himself, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-14">
saying, «Most surely I will bless
you, and I will surely multiply you.» 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-15">
Thus, having patiently endured,
he obtained the promise. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-16">
For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in
every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-17">
In this way
God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the
immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-18">
that by two
immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a
strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set
before us. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-19">
This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure
and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-6-20">
where as
a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after
the order of Melchizedek.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-7">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-7-1">
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who
met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-2">
to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by
interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is
king of peace; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-3">
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God),
remains a priest continually. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-4">
Now consider how great this man was, to
whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-5">
They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest´s office have a
commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of
their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-6">
but
he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and
has blessed him who has the promises. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-7">
But without any dispute the less
is blessed by the better. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-8">
Here people who die receive tithes, but there
one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-9">
So to say,
through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-10">
for he
was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-11">
Now if
there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the
people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest
to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of
Aaron? 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-12">
For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change
made also in the law. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-13">
For he of whom these things are said belongs to
another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-14">
For it is
evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke
nothing concerning priesthood. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-15">
This is yet more abundantly evident, if
after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-16">
who has
been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of
an endless life: 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-17">
for it is testified,

<cl/><fp>
«You are a priest forever,
<cl/>
According to the order of Melchizedek.»
</fp>


</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-7-18">
For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its
weakness and uselessness 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-19">
(for the law made nothing perfect), and a
bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-20">
Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-21">
(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with
an oath by him that says of him,

<cl/><fp>
«The Lord swore and will not change his mind,
<cl/>
`You are a priest forever,
<cl/>
According to the order of Melchizedek´».
</fp>


</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-7-22">
By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better covenant.

</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-23">
Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from
continuing by death. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-24">
But he, because he lives forever, has his
priesthood unchangeable. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-25">
Therefore he is also able to save to the
uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to
make intercession for them.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Hebrews-7-26">
For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled,
separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-27">
who doesn´t
need, like those high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his
own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For this he did once for all,
when he offered up himself. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-7-28">
For the law appoints men as high priests
who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints
a Son forever who has been perfected.

<cl/>


</sv></cm></sc>
<sc id="Hebrews-8">
<cm>
<sv id="Hebrews-8-1">
Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We
have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens, 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-2">
a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-3">
For every high priest is
appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that
this high priest also have something to offer. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-4">
For if he were on earth,
he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts
according to the law; 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-5">
who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly
things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the
tabernacle, for he said, «See, you shall make everything according to the
pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.» 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-6">
But now he has obtained
a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better
covenant, which has been enacted on better promises. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-7">
For if that first
covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a
second. 
</sv>
		<sv id="Hebrews-8-8">
For finding fault with them, he said,

<cl/><fp>
«Behold, the days come,» says the Lord,

«That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house

ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary. 
</sv>

For there was a
tabernacle prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the
show bread; which is called the Holy Place.

		<sv id="Hebrews-9-3">
After the second veil was
the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,

having a golden altar

which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron´s rod that budded, and the

and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the

himself, and for the errors of the people.

The Holy Spirit is indicating
this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn´t yet revealed while the first

which is a symbol of the present age,
where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the

For if the blood of goats

how much more will the blood of
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to
God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

</sv>

For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has
occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the

blood.

For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the
people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats,

According to the law, nearly
everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is
no remission.

It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things
in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than these.

For Christ hasn´t entered
into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but
into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;

yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the
holy place year by year with blood not his own,

suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of
the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this,
judgment,
