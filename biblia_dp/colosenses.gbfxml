even as
you

who also declared to us your love in

You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your
evil works,

Paul, was made a servant.

Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part

Be careful that you don´t let anyone

You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of

and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being

If you
