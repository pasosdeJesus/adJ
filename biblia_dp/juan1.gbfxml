If we say that we

Again, I write a new commandment to

Now, little children, remain in him, that

Beloved, now we are children of God, and it

Whoever is born

Don´t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.

By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we

My

And by this we know that we are of the truth,
