OpenSSL is an open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a
full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

This package is not intended for general-purpose use in OpenBSD - it
is present for test/comparison purposes, and occasionally to provide
support for applications which cannot be made compatible with LibreSSL
(mostly due to use of removed APIs); in the latter case care must be
taken - it will conflict if library dependencies use LibreSSL libraries.
