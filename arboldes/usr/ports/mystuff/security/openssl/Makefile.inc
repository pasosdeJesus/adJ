# XXX Don't use security/openssl/X in other ports unless there's a big problem
# or a specific reason why not to use LibreSSL with that port - it is easy to
# create runtime library conflicts. In those special cases, please add comments
# to the port explaining why OpenSSL is needed instead of LibreSSL and/or
# discuss on ports@.
