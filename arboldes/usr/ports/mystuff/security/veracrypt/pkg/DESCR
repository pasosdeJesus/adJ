VeraCrypt is a free open source disk encryption software for
Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

VeraCrypt main features:

- Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a
  real disk.
- Encrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash
  drive or hard drive.
- Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot
  authentication).
- Encryption is automatic, real-time(on-the-fly) and transparent.
- Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written
  as fast as if the drive was not encrypted.
- Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to
  reveal the password: Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden
  operating system.
