just is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called justfile with syntax
inspired by make.

If runnning `just` on OpenBSD you get an error like:

  error: Call to function just_executable failed: 
  Error getting current executable: no current exe available (short)

solve by running `/usr/local/bin/just` instead of `just`
( see https://github.com/casey/just/issues/2499 ).
