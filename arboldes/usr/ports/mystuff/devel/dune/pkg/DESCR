Dune (former jbuilder) is a build system that was designed to simplify the
release of Jane Street packages. It reads metadata from "dune" files following
a very simple s-expression syntax.

Dune is fast, it has very low overhead and supports parallel builds on all
platforms. It has no system dependencies, all you need to build dune and
packages using dune is OCaml. You don't need make or bash as long as the
packages themselves don't use bash explicitely.

Dune supports multi-package development by simply dropping multiple
repositories into the same directory.

It also supports multi-context builds, such as building against several opam
roots/switches simultaneously. This helps maintaining packages across several
versions of OCaml and gives cross-compilation for free.
