DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development 
using the packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick 
but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, 
run DataObject&apos;s createTable script over it and write a script that 
passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The 
FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm 
object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a 
processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() 
command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have 
set up DataObject&apos;s links.ini file correctly, it will also 
automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate 
a selectbox with the linked table&apos;s entries. There are many optional 
parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties 
of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, 
gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can 
take control at any stage of the process.
