findlib provides a scheme to manage reusable Objective Caml software
components in the form of libraries, and includes tools that support
this scheme.

A library installed as a findlib component is also called a package.
The point is that the findlib scheme allows it to store metainformation
about the library, especially how it can be used in programs. The
packages are kept in the filesystem hierarchy, but the directory
structure is defined by findlib, and there is no way to deviate
from this standard. The library contains functions to look the
directory up that stores a package, to query metainformation about
a package, and to retrieve dependency information about multiple
packages. There is also a tool that allows the user to enter queries
on the command-line. In order to simplify compilation and linkage,
there are new frontends of the various OCaml compilers that can
directly deal with packages.
