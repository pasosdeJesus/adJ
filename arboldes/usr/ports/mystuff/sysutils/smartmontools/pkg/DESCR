The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and
smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the
Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built
into most modern ATA and SCSI hard disks.  In many cases, these
utilities will provide advanced warning of disk degradation and failure.
