FreeXL is an open source library to extract valid data from within an
Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.  FreeXL intends to be simple, lightweight, and
completely ignores any GUI-related oddity.  Note that the final goal
means that FreeXL ignores at all fonts, sizes and alignments, and most
formats. It ignores Pivot Table, Charts, Formulas, Visual Basic macros
and so on.
