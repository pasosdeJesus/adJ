PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
object-relational database.  In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension.  PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
"Simple Features Specification for SQL" and has been certified as
compliant with the "Types and Functions" profile.
