sgmls.pm is an extensible perl5 class library for parsing the output from 
James Clark's popular sgmls and nsgmls parsers, available on the Internet 
at ftp://jclark.com.
This is not a complete system for translating documents written the the 
Standard Generalised Markup Language (sgml) into other formats, but it can 
easily form the basis of such a system (for a simple example, see the 
sgmlspl program included in this package).
 
The library recognises four basic types of sgml objects: the
element, the attribute, the notation, and the entity; each
of these is a fully-developed class with methods for accessing
important information.
