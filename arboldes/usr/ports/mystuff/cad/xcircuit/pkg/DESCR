XCircuit is a program for drawing publishable-quality electrical circuit
schematic diagrams and related figures, and produce circuit netlists
through schematic capture.  XCircuit regards circuits as inherently
hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical PostScript output and
hierarchical SPICE netlists.  Circuit components are saved in and
retrieved from libraries which are fully editable.

XCircuit is flexible enough to be used as a generic program for drawing
just about anything, and is competitive with powerful programs such as
"xfig". It is especially good for any task requiring repeated use of a
standard set of graphical objects, including architectural drawing,
printed circuit board layouts, and even music typography.
