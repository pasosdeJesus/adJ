.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The shell is supplied with a series of functions to replace and enhance the
traditional Unix \fBcalendar\fP programme, which warns the user of imminent
or future events, details of which are stored in a text file (typically
\fBcalendar\fP in the user\&'s home directory)\&.  The version provided here
includes a mechanism for alerting the user when an event is due\&.
.PP
In addition functions \fBage\fP, \fBbefore\fP and \fBafter\fP are provided
that can be used in a glob qualifier; they allow files to be selected
based on their modification times\&.
.PP
The format of the \fBcalendar\fP file and the dates used there in and in
the \fBage\fP function are described first, then the functions that can
be called to examine and modify the \fBcalendar\fP file\&.
.PP
The functions here depend on the availability of the \fBzsh/datetime\fP
module which is usually installed with the shell\&.  The library function
\fBstrptime()\fP must be available; it is present on most recent
operating systems\&.
.PP
.PP
.SH "FILE AND DATE FORMATS"
.PP
.SS "Calendar File Format"
.PP
The calendar file is by default \fB~/calendar\fP\&.  This can be configured
by the \fBcalendar\-file\fP style, see
the section STYLES below\&.  The basic format consists
of a series of separate lines, with no indentation, each including
a date and time specification followed by a description of the event\&.
.PP
Various enhancements to this format are supported, based on the syntax
of Emacs calendar mode\&.  An indented line indicates a continuation line
that continues the description of the event from the preceding line
(note the date may not be continued in this way)\&.  An initial ampersand
(\fB&\fP) is ignored for compatibility\&.
.PP
An indented line on which the first non\-whitespace character is \fB#\fP
is not displayed with the calendar entry, but is still scanned for
information\&.  This can be used to hide information useful to the
calendar system but not to the user, such as the unique identifier
used by \fBcalendar_add\fP\&.
.PP
The Emacs extension that a date with no description may refer to a number
of succeeding events at different times is not supported\&.
.PP
Unless the \fBdone\-file\fP style has been altered, any events which
have been processed are appended to the file with the same name as the
calendar file with the suffix \fB\&.done\fP, hence \fB~/calendar\&.done\fP by
default\&.
.PP
An example is shown below\&.
.PP
.SS "Date Format"
.PP
The format of the date and time is designed to allow flexibility without
admitting ambiguity\&.  (The words `date\&' and `time' are both used in the
documentation below; except where specifically noted this implies a string
that may include both a date and a time specification\&.)  Note that there is
no localization support; month and day names must be in English and
separator characters are fixed\&.  Matching is case insensitive, and only the
first three letters of the names are significant, although as a special
case a form beginning "month" does not match "Monday"\&.  Furthermore, time
zones are not handled; all times are assumed to be local\&.
.PP
It is recommended that, rather than exploring the intricacies of the
system, users find a date format that is natural to them and stick to it\&.
This will avoid unexpected effects\&.  Various key facts should be noted\&.
.PP
.PD 0

\(bu
In particular, note the confusion between
\fImonth\fP\fB/\fP\fIday\fP\fB/\fP\fIyear\fP and
\fIday\fP\fB/\fP\fImonth\fP\fB/\fP\fIyear\fP when the month is numeric; these
formats should be avoided if at all possible\&.  Many alternatives are
available\&.
.TP
\(bu
The year must be given in full to avoid confusion, and only years
from 1900 to 2099 inclusive are matched\&.
.PP
The following give some obvious examples; users finding here
a format they like and not subject to vagaries of style may skip
the full description\&.  As dates and times are matched separately
(even though the time may be embedded in the date), any date format
may be mixed with any format for the time of day provide the
separators are clear (whitespace, colons, commas)\&.

More detailed rules follow\&.
.PP
Times are parsed and extracted before dates\&.  They must use colons
to separate hours and minutes, though a dot is allowed before seconds
if they are present\&.  This limits time formats to the following:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
\fIHH\fP\fB:\fP\fIMM\fP[\fB:\fP\fISS\fP[\fB\&.\fP\fIFFFFF\fP]] [\fBam\fP|\fBpm\fP|\fBa\&.m\&.\fP|\fBp\&.m\&.\fP]

.PP
Here, square brackets indicate optional elements, possibly with
alternatives\&.  Fractions of a second are recognised but ignored\&.  For
absolute times (the normal format require by the \fBcalendar\fP file and the
\fBage\fP, \fBbefore\fP and \fBafter\fP functions) a date is mandatory but a
time of day is not; the time returned is at the start of the date\&.  One
variation is allowed: if \fBa\&.m\&.\fP or \fBp\&.m\&.\fP or one of their variants
is present, an hour without a minute is allowed, e\&.g\&. \fB3 p\&.m\&.\fP\&.
.PP
Time zones are not handled, though if one is matched following a time
specification it will be removed to allow a surrounding date to be
parsed\&.  This only happens if the format of the timezone is not too
unusual\&.  The following are examples of forms that are understood:
.PP
.RS
.nf

Any part of the timezone that is not numeric must have exactly three

.PP
Dates suffer from the ambiguity between \fIDD\fP\fB/\fP\fIMM\fP\fB/\fP\fIYYYY\fP
and \fIMM\fP\fB/\fP\fIDD\fP\fB/\fP\fIYYYY\fP\&.  It is recommended this form is
avoided with purely numeric dates, but use of ordinals,
eg\&. \fB3rd/04/2007\fP, will resolve the ambiguity as the ordinal is always
parsed as the day of the month\&.  Years must be four digits (and the first
two must be \fB19\fP or \fB20\fP); \fB03/04/08\fP is not recognised\&.  Other
numbers may have leading zeroes, but they are not required\&.  The following
are handled:

Here, \fIMNM\fP is at least the first three letters of a month name,
matched case\-insensitively\&.  The remainder of the month name may appear but
its contents are irrelevant, so janissary, febrile, martial, apricot,
maybe, junta, etc\&. are happily handled\&.
.PP
Where the year is shown as optional, the current year is assumed\&.  There
are only two such cases, the form \fBJun 20\fP or \fB14 September\fP (the only
two commonly occurring forms, apart from a "the" in some forms of English,
which isn\&'t currently supported)\&.  Such dates will of course become
ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be avoided\&.
.PP
Times may follow dates with a colon, e\&.g\&. \fB1965/07/12:09:45\fP; this is in
order to provide a format with no whitespace\&.  A comma and whitespace are
allowed, e\&.g\&. \fB1965/07/12, 09:45\fP\&.  Currently the order of these
separators is not checked, so illogical formats such as \fB1965/07/12, :
,09:45\fP will also be matched\&.  For simplicity such variations are not shown
in the list above\&.  Otherwise, a time is only recognised as being
associated with a date if there is only whitespace in between, or if the
time was embedded in the date\&.
.PP
Days of the week are not normally scanned, but will be ignored if they
occur at the start of the date pattern only\&.  However, in contexts where it
is useful to specify dates relative to today, days of the week with no
other date specification may be given\&.  The day is assumed to be either
today or within the past week\&.  Likewise, the words \fByesterday\fP,
\fBtoday\fP and \fBtomorrow\fP are handled\&.  All matches are case\-insensitive\&.
Hence if today is Monday, then \fBSunday\fP is equivalent to \fByesterday\fP,
\fBMonday\fP is equivalent to \fBtoday\fP, but \fBTuesday\fP gives a date six
days ago\&.  This is not generally useful within the calendar file\&.
Dates in this format may be combined with a time specification; for
example \fBTomorrow, 8 p\&.m\&.\fP\&.
.PP
For example, the standard date format:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBFri Aug 18 17:00:48 BST 2006\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is handled by matching \fIHH\fP\fB:\fP\fIMM\fP\fB:\fP\fISS\fP and removing it
together with the matched (but unused) time zone\&.  This leaves the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBFri Aug 18 2006\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBFri\fP is ignored and the rest is matched according to the standard rules\&.
.PP
.SS "Relative Time Format"
.PP
In certain places relative times are handled\&.  Here, a date is not allowed;
instead a combination of various supported periods are allowed, together
with an optional time\&.  The periods must be in order from most to
least significant\&.
.PP
In some cases, a more accurate calculation is possible when there is an
anchor date:  offsets of months or years pick the correct day, rather than
being rounded, and it is possible to pick a particular day in a month as
`(1st Friday)\&', etc\&., as described in more detail below\&.
.PP
Anchors are available in the following cases\&.  If one or two times are
passed to the function \fBcalendar\fP, the start time acts an anchor for the
end time when the end time is relative (even if the start time is
implicit)\&.  When examining calendar files, the scheduled event being
examined anchors the warning time when it is given explicitly by means of
the \fBWARN\fP keyword; likewise, the scheduled event anchors a repetition
period when given by the \fBRPT\fP keyword, so that specifications such as
\fBRPT 2 months, 3rd Thursday\fP are handled properly\&.  Finally, the \fB\-R\fP
argument to \fBcalendar_scandate\fP directly provides an anchor for relative
calculations\&.
.PP

of 30 days rather than a calendar month unless there is an anchor\&.

.PP
Spaces between the numbers are optional, but are required between items,
although a comma may be used (with or without spaces)\&.
.PP
The forms \fByearly\fP to \fBhourly\fP allow the number to be omitted; it is
assumed to be 1\&.  For example, \fB1 d\fP and \fBdaily\fP are equivalent\&.  Note
that using those forms with plurals is confusing; \fB2 yearly\fP is the same
as \fB2 years\fP, \fInot\fP twice yearly, so it is recommended they only
be used without numbers\&.
.PP
When an anchor time is present, there is an extension to handle regular
events in the form of the \fIn\fPth \fIsome\fPday of the month\&.  Such a
specification must occur immediately after any year and month
specification, but before any time of day, and must be in the form
\fIn\fP(\fBth\fP|\fBst\fP|\fBrd\fP) \fIday\fP, for example \fB1st Tuesday\fP or
\fB3rd Monday\fP\&.  As in other places, days are matched case insensitively,
must be in English, and only the first three letters are significant except
that a form beginning `month\&' does not match `Monday'\&.  No attempt is made
to sanitize the resulting date; attempts to squeeze too many occurrences
into a month will push the day into the next month (but in the obvious
fashion, retaining the correct day of the week)\&.

Use the shell\&'s \fBsched\fP command to schedule a timed event that

blocks the scheduled task from running until it is finished\&.
.RS
.PP
The timed event usually runs the programme \fBcalendar_show\fP to show
the event, as described in
the section UTILITY FUNCTIONS below\&.
.PP
By default, a warning of the event is shown five minutes before it is due\&.
The warning period can be configured by the style \fBwarn\-time\fP or
for a single calendar entry by including \fBWARN\fP \fIreltime\fP in the first
line of the entry, where \fIreltime\fP is one of the usual relative time
formats\&.
.PP
A repeated event may be indicated by including \fBRPT\fP \fIreldate\fP in the
first line of the entry\&.  After the scheduled event has been displayed
it will be re\-entered into the calendar file at a time \fIreldate\fP
after the existing event\&.  Note that this is currently the only use
made of the repeat count, so that it is not possible to query the schedule
for a recurrence of an event in the calendar until the previous event
has passed\&.
.PP
If \fBRPT\fP is used, it is also possible to specify that certain
recurrences of an event are rescheduled or cancelled\&.  This is
done with the \fBOCCURRENCE\fP keyword, followed by whitespace and the
date and time of the occurrence in the regular sequence, followed by
whitespace and either the date and time of the rescheduled event or
the exact string \fBCANCELLED\fP\&.  In this case the date and time must
be in exactly the "date with local time" format used by the
\fBtext/calendar\fP MIME type (RFC 2445),
\fI<YYYY><MM><DD>\fP\fBT\fP\fI<hh><mm><ss>\fP (note the presence of the literal
character \fBT\fP)\&.  The first word (the regular recurrence) may be
something other than a proper date/time to indicate that the event
is additional to the normal sequence; a convention that retains
the formatting appearance is \fBXXXXXXXXTXXXXXX\fP\&.
.PP
Furthermore, it is useful to record the next regular recurrence
(as then the displayed date may be for a rescheduled event so cannot
be used for calculating the regular sequence)\&.  This is specified by
\fBRECURRENCE\fP and a time or date in the same format\&.  \fBcalendar_add\fP
adds such an indication when it encounters a recurring event that does not
include one, based on the headline date/time\&.
.PP
If \fBcalendar_add\fP is used to update occurrences the \fBUID\fP keyword
described there should be present in both the existing entry and the added
occurrence in order to identify recurring event sequences\&.
