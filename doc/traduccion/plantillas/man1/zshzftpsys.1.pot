"This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source "

"perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions or "
"scripts\\&.  The interface is similar to a traditional FTP client "
"(e\\&.g\\&. the B<ftp> command itself, see I<ftp>(1)), but as it is entirely "
"done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing "
"features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to "
